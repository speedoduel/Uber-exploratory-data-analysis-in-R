# Uber-exploratory-data-analysis-in-R
## A extensive exploratory data analysis project in R made by me using uber data from 2014
### Many of the Fortune 500 companies need data analytics to make better insights in running their especially a massive corporate enterprise like Uber can use it too to scale and chart out places where the traffic and accordingly put a differing fare for those spots and also be placing more drivers in that region to handle the high customer demand. Here we have done just that we imported the data sets containing the uber travel records and just tried to clean the data and make insights on how has does different dates and months affect the company and it's cab requests

### Steps and Insights made in this project
- Employed multiple data analysis libraries in R such as Tidyr, DT, ggthemes, ggplot, lubridate, scales
- Join different CSV files factored in the Data and Cleaned it
- inded the data together using rbind
- I alloted a seperate set of colors which i later gave to my graphs to increase their color assortment for a better viewing of the data
- cleaned and preprocessed the data separated the date and columns
- I made several smaller datasets to make easy grouping of data by group by
- I made bar graphs on all possible relations between the data set and analyzed and researched the reason behind each day of loss
- I also made heatmaps all of the previously discussed matters of importance to find more patterns 
- Finally I made a map of the entire newyork city on the basis of longitude and latitude which i then utilized the map to get find if one common area had a large number of 
commutes on a specific and that turned out to be monday here in lower manhatten
